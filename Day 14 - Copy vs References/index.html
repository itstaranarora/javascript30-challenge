    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // 2 ways of copying a array
    const copy1 = [...players];
    const copy2 = Array.from(players);
    
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // Different ways to copy a object

    const obj1 = {...person};
    const obj2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
